    <p>Iâ€™m a Product Designer who thrives on helping businesses grow through user-centric, data-driven, creative design. My past experience includes Digital Marketing, HR, Recruiting, and a BA in Psychology from The Ohio State University. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and am currently looking to help businesses grow through my expertise and build my clientele. I believe the key to improving functionality and enjoyment for users requires acknowledging their needs and frustrations, and being able to execute based on those needs. </p>
